Task 3: Scheduling.
Supervised by: Figat Maksym.
Done by: Abdulla, Mahmood (302840)


Task:
Is to run a configuration file that runs a number of process for a given time with a variety of parameters.
The given parameters are: Average run time (2000 milliseconds), Standard deviation of zero, block time for I/O every 500 milliseconds.
The total run time of execution cannot exceed 10000 milliseconds.
The configuration file will run using 2, 5 and 10 process, which will have a results output file that differs in every execution.

First simulation (2 Processes):
_______________________________ 
From the results output file, we can notice that the simulation run time did not use the total simulation time given in the
configuration file, that is because every process only needs 2000 millisecond (total 4000 milliseconds for both).
The CPU blocked each process three times and just before blocking them for the fourth time, the processes were done running.




Second simulation (5 processes):
________________________________
 
In the second simulation, the whole run time specified were used, that is due to the processes total run time is equal to the
simulation run time. As mentioned in the previous simulation, the number of times a process was blocked is three before it finished
running successfully.




Third Simulation (10 processes):
_______________________________ 

In the third simulations things were a bit different, we can notice that only 4 processes has finished running 
completely (processes 0 to 3), while two process completed only half the time it has to run (processes 4 and 5) and 
processes beyond process five did not get a chance to run at all. 
The first four processes has sufficient time to complete running successfully, while processes 4 and 5 were interrupted before
finishing because the total run time for the simulation was up before completion, and finally the last 4 processes did not start
at all because the simulation time has ended before any of those has a chance to start.
